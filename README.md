# TicTacToe-Project

This is a simple console-based Tic Tac Toe game implemented in Java using Swing.

Overview
This project is a Java implementation of the classic Tic Tac Toe game using the Swing GUI toolkit. The game allows two players to take turns and marks their respective moves on a 3x3 grid until a player wins or the game ends in a draw.

How to Play
The game is played on a 3x3 grid. Player 1 is represented by "X," and Player 2 is represented by "O." The players take turns to mark an empty cell in the grid. The first player to have three of their marks in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) wins the game. If all cells are filled and no player has three marks in a row, the game is a draw.
